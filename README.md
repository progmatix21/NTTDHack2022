# NTT Data AI Hackathon 2022

## AI in Healthcare

This repository is the submission for the hackathon from **team ATR21**.  The
submission is a web-app based on Machine Learning models trained on cardio
vascular and diabetic data, which can be used to predict the respective
conditions based on user-provided inputs. 

### Repository contents

 - Datasets
 - Jupyter Notebooks for training models (in progress)
 - Documentation
 - Web-app

### Prerequisites and Configuration

 - The app and the ML models are developed using Anaconda Data Science platform 4.11.0 
 - No configuration is needed unless you want to update the models with new data
 or further tune the model hyperparameters
 - To tune the models, use the Jupyter Lab notebooks.
 
### Installation

 - Clone or unzip this repository in your folder
 - Run `healthpred.py`. This will start a Flask web server on port 8080
 - Access this app via your browser at `localhost:8080`

### Usage
